Free energy of solvation of toluene MD lab 

This repo gives a minimal example of how to run an MD lab where you compute the free energy of solvation of toluene using GROMACS and GROMOS54A7.
All the final data is provided in this case, however feel free to get the students to actually run the simulations.
